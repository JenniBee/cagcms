Our maintenance and repair services can actually be broken into two separate categories: (a) maintenance and (b) repair.','<h2>Maintenance</h2> If you have a web site that requires constant updates (weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.), those updates are referred to as &quot;maintenance&quot;. We offer timely, high-quality service in this vein. Our prices for this work are the same as our custom web design prices, but require far less work than a new site. In most cases, simple updates take less than an hour, resulting in a charge for one hour&#39;s worth of work. <h2>Repair</h2>Repair of web sites requires a little more work than maintenance, but still generally requires much less than custom web design. If you are happy with some elements of your site, but would like to drastically change other elements, you should consider repairing your site. Sometimes, this can be as simple as adding a new menu, or new images, to all of your pages. Other times, you may want to completely revamp the appearance or function of your site. Either way, it might be simpler to repair the work that has already been done. <p><font class=\"small\" color=\"red\"> Please keep in mind that we are unable to use sites that belong to third parties. Therefore, if you are not actually the owner of the work that appears on the site, you will need to go with our custom web services, as opposed to our maintenance and repair services. Some web designers claim the work that they do as their own, meaning that their clients do not own that work. Other designers simply create the site, and sign ownership over to the clients. Only in this latter instance are we able to perform maintenance or repair services.</font>  </p><h2> Maintenance, Repair and Remodeling Prices</h2> In most cases, the prices for maintenance, repair and remodeling will coincide with the prices for custom web design. The thing to remember, though, is that repair, maintenance and remodeling require substantially smaller amounts of work than custom design from scratch. Pricing exceptions might be made if the repair or remodeling requires a great deal of work, due to sloppy programming on the part of the previous designer.

You can decide to either host your page/site on our domain, or you can register your own domain.','<h2>Ten-321.com Hosting</h2>  If you choose to host your web page or site on our domain, Ten-321.com, your address will be www.Ten-321.com/<em>Your Name</em> (you can choose to use any combination of letters and numbers in place of the words &quot;Your Name&quot;). Also, along with having a place to park your web site/page, you will receive a unique pop email address: <em>Your Name</em>@Ten-321.com. You can receive email from that email address using any pop-based email program (Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora, etc.) or you can send and receive from your browser. In order to send email using a pop-based email program, you will need to have your own internet access. This option is recommended if you are having a web page, as opposed to a web site, designed for you. However, even if you do decide to contract an entire site, this option is still available. <h2>Custom Domain Registration</h2>If you choose to register your own domain name, we have many different packages from which to choose. We affiliate ourselves with quite a few different hosting companies, allowing us to offer a wide variety of packages at many different prices. You choose the package and price that is right for you. <p>Because we are simply affiliates with the various hosting companies, however, we can offer no guarantee of the service provided.

The registration process for web sites can sometimes be a very confusing and expensive one. We have done a great deal of research, working to come up with the best hosting packages on the web. Many companies offer great hosting rates, but have no customer support. Other companies have wonderful packages, but their prices are sky-high. In order to register for the right hosting package, you have to know what you need. For instance, someone who has three pages on their web site, and very few graphics, certainly does not need to pay $50/month for 500MB of web space. A company that has 4 employees will probably never need 50 different email addresses. <p>We understand what all of our packages include, and we can help you decide which one is right for you. Do not pay too much for a web hosting plan. Just as you would not buy a 4X4 Ford Expedition if you were looking for a fuel-efficient vehicle, you should not pay for a hosting package that you do not understand. </p><p>If you do have an understanding of how things work on the web, then we encourage you to find the bargains for yourself.

However, if you feel that you would like to include a wealth of information that would be better suited for a book or catalogue, then a web site is definitely the way to go. The thing to keep in mind is this: You want your visitors to be able to view all of your information in the easiest possible way. If you feel that it would be easiest to keep it all on the same page, then a web page will work out wonderfully. If you feel that the information would become clouded, confusing, or that your readers would lose interest if it were all clumped together, then you should definitely consider an entire site. </p><h2>What if I still can&#39;t decide?</h2>  <p>If you are unsure of which option you should choose, then we suggest starting of with a web page.

mysql_query("INSERT INTO `content` VALUES (8,4,2,'created','How Was This Site Made?','How Was This Web Site Created?','This web site was created entirely by the staff of Ten-321 Enterprises. Four separate elements of web design were combined to develop the site you see. Those four elements are listed and explained below.','<h2><a name=\"Cre-Copy\"></a>Copywriting</h2><p> To begin, our staff had to write and edit all of the copy found on this site. Every word included on this site was planned and carefully chosen before the site was ever created.</p><p>If a customer wishes us to design their site, they must provide the copy. If the customer does not have copy prepared prior to the site design, we offer copy writing and editing services.</p><h2><a name=\"Cre-Layout\"></a>Site Layout</h2><p>The next step in the design process was to decide exactly how the site should look and function. Layout is actually divided into three subcategories: deciding how the overall site should appear, choosing the look of each individual page, and making sure that each page efficiently connects to all other pages.</p><p>The first part of this step was to decide exactly how the entire site would appear. For this site, we decided to work on a variation of our original site (later incorporated into Template Page 1). We chose to include a banner and a &quot;Home button&quot; at the top of every page, with a menu running down the left side. In order to maintain a symmetrical appearance, we decided to include advertisements on the right side of each page. We also needed to choose the colors that would be used. Because red, white and black are the three colors incorporated in our logo, we decided to use them. We added the color yellow because it contrasts well with red and black.</p><p>The next part of the layout process was to make any and all decisions concerning individual pages. We needed to choose the typefaces, fonts, and text sizes for each element of each page. For a few pages we needed to alter our approach slightly, but we made sure to plan for those instances.</p><p>The final part of the layout process was to determine exactly how the site, as a whole, would function. We needed to make sure that users could easily navigate between pages, and that they would always know where they were and how to get out.</p><p>In order to accomplish all three of these steps, we drew mock-ups of each page, making sure we knew where to place the text, and which images to include. We then needed to draw a diagram, mapping out the heirarchy of pages, and making sure that everything would be accessible.</p><h2><a name=\"Cre-Image\"></a>Image Creation</h2>After we figured out exactly how we wanted the site to look, we had to begin creating the images that appear on our site. Our logo, our banner, the toolbar buttons, our sample images, the miscellaneous information images, and the advertisements all had to be created and optimized for consumption on the web. Our logo was designed by <a href=\"http://jon.sandruck.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jon Sandruck&#39;s Graphic Design Site\">Jon Sandruck</a>, one of our former graphic design subcontractors. It was then converted to digital format, and adjusted for optimal appearance on this site. The rest of the images were created specifically for this web site.<h2><a name=\"Cre-HTML\"></a>Coding</h2><p>Once everything was ready to be included in the site, we had to begin actually creating it. For this site, we decided to build our own <u>C</u>ontent <u>M</u>anagement <u>S</u>ystem (CMS) out of PHP.&nbsp; Our CMS uses PHP to communicate with a MySQL database to store and retrieve the information found on this site.&nbsp; The purpose of the CMS was to make it easy to create multiple pages at once, using the same basic template for the entire site.&nbsp; Our CMS breaks the site into sections, then categories, and then into individual pages.&nbsp; Our CMS dynamically generates the menus found on our site, and automatically retrieves the appropriate information from our database.&nbsp; At that point, it is all put together and displayed on your screen.  <br /></p><p>We then used HTML (<u>h</u>yper<u>t</u>ext <u>m</u>ark-up <u>l</u>anguage) and CSS (<u>c</u>ascading <u>s</u>tyle <u>s</u>heets) to create the actual layout of the site.&nbsp; HTML is the main language used to layout elements on the web.&nbsp; HTML is used to include various elements in the site, including the text itself, the graphics, the forms, etc.&nbsp; CSS gives web designers a way of re-defining the look of elements that would normally have standard, static definitions.&nbsp; CSS was used on this site to define the colors, the fonts, and the actual positioning of all of the elements found on this site. </p><h2><a name=\"Cre-Summary\"></a>Summary</h2><p>In conclusion, this site is the result of careful planning and hard work. Copy had to be written and edited. Styles and appearances had to be determined, then defined through programming. Images had to be created and converted.</p><p> A great deal of programming and expertise had to be utilized in order to create the site you are now viewing. Nothing on this site happened by accident. Every element is a result of diligent planning, research, and labor. <br /></p><p>The final thing to remember, however, is that no web site is ever complete. There are always elements of a site that can be improved. There is always content that should be changed. Web sites should always be considered works-in-progress.</p><p>The World Wide Web is constantly changing. Programmers are continuously pushing the limits of all programming languages.

The problem is, though, that those programs are created to simply generate code; they do not actually design the site. Sure, there are template pages included in many of those programs, but they are very inflexible. In addition, many web programs generate code for every single instance, creating a much larger document than you would ever need. We will not lie; some of these programs can be incredibly helpful if you already know what you are doing. If you have a great deal of experience in web programming, and you know which elements you would like to include in your site, these programs can save quite a bit of time. If you know nothing about web design and programming, these programs are incredibly inefficient. <p>Before you decide whether or not you should create your own web site, please read our page on how a web site is created. Once you have read that, and completely understand all of the elements that go in to designing a web site, you will be better equipped to make that decision. If your business does indeed have employees that know how to complete each of those steps, then you certainly should have them do your web design. However, if even one of those steps can not be completed, then your web site will not be as effective as it should be; as it needs to be. </p><p>As a small business, we understand that you cannot afford to pay your employees to learn web design and programming. You also cannot afford to wait, while they play trial and error games with your site. At the same time, you cannot afford to pay most professional web designers. That is where Ten-321 Enterprises fits in. Because we are a small business, aimed at a target clientelle of small businesses, we offer special packages and deals to help you get your site up and running. We also are willing to work with all of our clients, and customize our services for each one. Our prices are extremely competitive, and affordable for small businesses.

While we create great-looking web pages, we also keep the visitor in mind. Not everyone has DSL or cable internet access. Not everyone has state-of-the-art computers with lightning-fast processors. Not everyone has 27&quot; flat screen monitors with which to view the websites. We design websites that will impress everyone, not just the select few that have recently spent thousands of dollars on the latest trend in computer technology. </p><p>We offer more experience than a lot of designers on the market. We offer a young perspective, with an appetite for new challenges. We offer affordable prices. We offer a desparate need to please the customer. We offer an old-fashioned work ethic in this modern technological cyber-world. We offer everything you should look for in a web designer. If you choose to work with another web designer, that is your decision. Keep in mind, though, that we offer the best service, the best prices and the best product on the web today.</p><h2><a name=\"WhyPro-Graphic\"></a>Why should I hire a professional to design my brochures, business cards, etc.?</h2>Sure, there are also some wonderful programs designed to help people do desktop publishing. If there weren&#39;t, there wouldn&#39;t be so many desktop publishers out there. The problem is, though, that the desktop publishing programs don&#39;t design your brochures, business cards, letterhead, etc. for you. In order to create effective stationary, business cards, etc. you need to have experience in graphic design. A business card, for many businesses, is the first impression potential customers get. Unfortunately, a business card is only as effective as its designer. If the card is too cluttered, it will never work. If it contains misleading information, or no real information at all, it will never work. Indeed, graphic layout is much easier when using computer programs, but only if you know what you are doing ahead of time. There are so many mistakes to be made when designing a brochure, stationary, order form, etc. As a small business, can you afford to make a costly mistake? Probably not. <p>Where does Ten-321 Enterprises fit into this equation? Many of the statements made about web design are also true about graphic layout. You cannot afford to pay your employees to learn new skills that have very little to do with their job. When you need new order forms or letterhead right away, you cannot afford to wait for your employees to figure out how to use new computer programs. On top of that, you probably do not want to spend your money to buy many of the good graphic layout programs. Your business has better things on which to spend its money.</p><h2><a name=\"WhyPro-10Graphic\"></a>Why Use Ten-321 for your Graphic needs?</h2>  <p>At Ten-321, we can offer the best of the best in print media.

He wrote the book, edited it, and published it. The success of the book enouraged him to begin his own company, working for performers, writers, and graphic artists.','<p>In early 2000, Ten-321 Enterprises became a division of PaperWorks of Nokesville, Inc. PaperWorks was founded in 1993 to fill the niche of &quot;short-run&quot; custom printing and graphics services for small to medium size organizations. Ten-321 used the facilities and equipment provided by PaperWorks to make their products available to a wider range of people. They maintained their focus on artists of any nature. </p><p>As the year 2000 came to a close, PaperWorks closed its doors to the public. Ten-321 Enterprises decided to expand and relocate. Moving out of Nokesville, Virginia and into Martinsburg, West Virginia, they shifted their geographical focus from the Northern Virginia/Metropolitan Washington DC area to the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, and its surrounding areas. They also shifted their focus from performers and artists to small businesses and working class citizens trying to move forward in the world of business. Because of the limitations that arose when PaperWorks, Inc. closed its doors, our entire focus has become web-based, no longer offering in-house printing. Upon special request, however, we can put you in contact with good, professional printers to help spread your word through paper. </p><p>Ten-321 Enterprises is family owned and operated. Customer satisfaction is extremely important to us. Ten-321 is run by Curtiss Grymala, a small business owner/operator in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. Because of the size and nature of Ten-321 Enterprises, we are able to offer extremely competitive rates and prices, as well as a significant understanding of the trials and tribulations small businesses face. </p>',1155775826,1155775826,0,0,0,NULL)", $link);
